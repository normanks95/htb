This repository contains the writeup of the machines I have done on hackthebox on my own. I have also attached the scripts used.
The pdf would be kept password protected till the machine is retired. I would be adding lessons learned which would not be password protected.

Machines done so far:
<ol>
<li>Knife</li>
</li>Cap</li>
</ol>
